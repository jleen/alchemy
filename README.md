Textual Alchemy
===============

Everyone else has their quirky attempt at a minimalist markup language, so
here's mine.  I developed it in order to typeset a significant-length (~90 page)
book in LaTeX while also being plausibly able to publish the material to the
web.  I ended up only partially using it for that, but it's still sort of
conceptually interesting.
